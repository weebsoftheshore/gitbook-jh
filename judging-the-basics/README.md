# Judging: The Basics

Judging at an event does not begin and end with a judge call. A judge must be present and attentive throughout a tournament to ensure that it proceeds smoothly. Players look to judges not only to maintain fair play but also as a resource for information regarding the event, questions regarding interactions, requests for accommodations, and, sometimes, presence as a mediator when situations get heated.

Judges need a few skills to facilitate these roles and responsibilities. Among them are:

1. [Impartiality](impartiality.md)
2. [Communication](communication.md)
3. [Teamwork](teamwork.md)
4. [Professionalism](professionalism.md)
5. [Game Knowledge](game-knowledge.md)

While many of the thresholds for advancing through the judge program measure game knowledge, the reality is that much of judging goes beyond the rulebook and policy documents.&#x20;
