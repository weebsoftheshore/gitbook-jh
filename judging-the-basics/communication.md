# Communication

Judges' tasks are mostly executed through communication, and, as such, this means that communication is an extremely important skill. When mediating judge calls, the language and tact used when interviewing players, issuing rulings, and delivering penalties are very important.&#x20;

Judges should speak confidently when attending a call or speaking to a player. Even when a judge is unsure of the right answer, it is still possible to confidently and clearly communicate this with the follow-through of getting another judge's opinion. Related to this, the use of decisive language may help convey confidence. E.g., rather than beginning to answer a question regarding an interaction with "I think," simply answer the interaction. It is more helpful to add that you would like to verify this interpretation with another judge than leading with an undecisive and unconfident "I think."

It is best practice to avoid using argumentative or connotatively negative language when communicating with players. Judges need to err on the side of de-escalating every situation, staying calm, and remaining cool-headed. Not only does this convey respect for the players, but it also establishes a good communication environment to reach the correct answer and the right words to deliver it.

As a reminder, judges speak with players rather than _to_ players. Judging is a collaboration between the judge and the player rather than a one-sided issuance of a ruling or command. Avoiding condescending language is a must, especially when explaining complex topics or interactions. While judges typically have more rules knowledge than players, it's imperative that judges not make players feel either embarrassed or uncomfortable asking questions; this dynamic would be counterproductive.

As Grand Archive brings communities of players together at some tournaments, sometimes communication barriers form. In these situations, it is important to smooth these barriers as much as possible, either by delegating judges who are proficient in translating the languages at issue or by being resourceful and using translational apps to effectively convey information (without a better alternative, such as a translator).
