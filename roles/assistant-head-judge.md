# Assistant Head Judge

The Assistant Head Judge role is typically assigned by the Head Judge to another judge on the team at premier events. While this judge will primarily fulfill the same responsibilities as a regular judge during the course of the event, the Assistant Head Judge will take over the Head Judge's role and responsibilities for side events and sub-tournaments hosted at premier events. This is done to alleviate the administrative burden on Head Judges so they may focus on the main events and important decisions that must be made. The Assistant Head Judge does not, however, have responsibilities such as conducting any sort of performance reviews. This role primarily exist as an auxiliary role to the Head Judge to smooth tournament proceedings for side or other non-main events.

Whenever the Head Judge is not available, the Assistant Head Judge can temporarily serve as the person to whom rulings can be escalated and from whom a final ruling is issued. Leaning on our philosophy in terms of impartiality, the Assistant Head Judge can also weigh in on any situations in which a Head Judge feels the need to recuse themselves from any calls or decisions if authority is deferred.
