# Stream Judging

Stream judging typically happens during premier events where players seated at a featured match table have their game recorded via camera and broadcast. Judges selected for stream judging can take a role from among, generally, two different ones: Multimedia observation versus table judging. In either case, those selected or volunteered for stream judging are typically trained with multimedia equipment, including the life counters or other accessories present for production.

During stream judging, the table judge has the responsibility to track the game state and assist with representing changes in it, placing counters when needed, marking appropriate damage, or writing down any public information that may be necessary to assist players, broadcasters, and viewers. The table judge can pause the game at any point in time to either verify information, correct a game state, or for any justifiable reason, such as intervening to prevent a potential error from happening. This is different from floor judging, where floor judges do not typically intervene unless a game rule violation has occurred or to fix an already-errored game state.

The other role that some stream judges may take is an observational one from the multimedia and production section of a venue, where they may monitor the communication and recorded gameplay to verify and validate any transpired game states. They can communicate with the table judge to issue a pause in the game if needed, as well.

As opposed to following the rule of one judge being the only judge to attend a call, if there are two active stream judges, they may collaborate to examine a game state and agree upon a corrective procedure and penalty to apply. Of course, this may be appealed to the Head Judge as with any decision. If only one judge is available as the table judge during stream judging, the protocol is no different from the typical procedures that happen during a judge call.
