# Table Judging

Table judging occurs when a judge sits next to players playing a match at a table to solely focus on the match. [Stream Judging](stream-judging.md) is a subsection of Table Judging specifically applied to feature matches that are broadcast as part of media coverage during an event.

For table judging, similar principles for floor judging are applied, but a judge's focus can be placed entirely on the play patterns of the players at the table, closely examining any actions and communications that either result in or could result in violations. As the judge is effectively present for the full context of any events that cause a judge to call, less time is needed to interview players to gain an account of events.
