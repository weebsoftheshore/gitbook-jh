# Deck Check Teams

Judges selected for the deck check team conduct deck checks routinely throughout events, primarily premier events. While deck checks are not an exclusive responsibility to only the deck check team, the responsibility of this team is solely based on the routine checks; any judge may perform a deck check during the round if necessary.

Typically, tables will be selected at random with a preference for tables from among those in contention for a top cut during the event and the players will be notified prior to any play that their decks will be checked. Their decks are then examined and compared to their submitted decklists for any inconsistencies, signs of tampering, or any malicious intent.

While the Tournament Rules & Guidelines document covers a majority of the steps and considerations when it comes to deck checks, here a couple of reminders of things to look for:

* Complete set of cards noted on the decklist is identified, including any intended generated cards and tokens to be used in a game
* Presence of excessive or patterned marking/damage on the cards or sleeves
* Appropriate proxying/altering of cards
* Illegal/banned cards being played
