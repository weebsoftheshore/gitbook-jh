# Roles

This section will cover the basic roles judges may take and the responsibilities that fall under each role.

Principally, there are three roles in which judges can fall under, in addition to sub-roles associated with a team designation when judging at premier events.

* [Judge](judge.md)
* [Head Judge](head-judge.md)
* [Assistant Head Judge](assistant-head-judge.md)

\
Team roles can be some of the following:

* [Deck Check](deck-check-teams.md)
* [Stream](table-judging/stream-judging.md)
* [Side Events](side-event.md)

Other than team-based roles, another aspect of judging is [table](table-judging/) vs [floor ](floor-judging.md)judging.
